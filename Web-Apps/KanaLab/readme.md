# KanaLab 🇯🇵

A user-centric Japanese learning app designed for flexible, non-linear study. Master Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and real sentences at your own pace, without restrictive level-gating.

**(Currently in Development)**

## About The Project

Many language-learning apps lock you into a predefined path, forcing you to complete "Level 1" before you can even see "Level 2". KanaLab is built on a different philosophy: **user freedom**.

This project is designed for learners who know what they need to work on.
* Want to drill *only* the Katakana 'K' group? Go for it.
* Want to jump straight into N5 Kanji without finishing all the Hiragana lessons? You can.
* Want to practice recognizing symbols (Romaji -> Kana) instead of reading them (Kana -> Romaji)? Just check a box.

KanaLab puts you in control of your study session, allowing you to build the exact quiz you need, right when you need it.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Kana Training:** Full modules for Hiragana and Katakana, broken down by phonetic groups (Vowels, K-group, S-group, etc.).
* **Essential Kanji:** A growing database of essential Kanji, grouped by themes (Numbers, Nature, People, etc.) to learn contextually.
* **Sentence Practice:** Reconstruct real-world Japanese sentences, practicing grammar and vocabulary in context.
* **User-Driven Difficulty:**
    * **Inverted Mode:** Flip the cards! Practice recognition (e.g., "ka") by choosing the correct symbol (e.g., "か").
    * **Hard Mode:** No multiple-choice. Type the Romaji translation yourself for a true test of knowledge.
    * **Custom Sessions:** Select *exactly* which groups you want to include in your training session.
* **Gamified Testing:**
    * **Focused Tests:** Prove your mastery with 25-question comprehensive tests.
    * **Increased Challenge:** Test questions feature 8 choices instead of 4 to challenge your recognition skills.
    * **Lives System:** A simple lives system makes practice feel like a game.
* **User Accounts & Stats:**
    * A simple, `localStorage`-based account system to save progress.
    * Tracks wins for each mode (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, Sentences) and total losses.
